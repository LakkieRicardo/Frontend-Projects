# Uploads Viewer

This project is designed to operate off the directory listing on [uploads.lakkie.net](https://uploads.lakkie.net), and to be uploaded to [uploads.lakkie.net/view/](https://uploads.lakkie.net/view/).

This uses the nginx directly listing in order to retrieve the list of files. It updates in real time, and attempts to create a preview of the uploaded file.
